# Email-Summariser
Here, I have developed a full-fledged web application, which fetches mails from the gmail, shows them in the form of inboxes, and then summarises the entire thread of conversation.

You can play around with the algorithm changine the weights given to Tf-Idf vectorizer, LDA, and sentence embeddings.

You need to include instance directory in the code structure for purpose related to databases.

Firstly, you need to enable Gmail API by visiting Google Cloud Console, and doing appropriate steps, then you need to fetch crednials.json file and save it in the same directory as the project. You can run the project by simply typing
```python app.py``` command in the console, and you can start using the app in your localhost.
